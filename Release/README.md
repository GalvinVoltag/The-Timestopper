### �How to work with controllers�
Unfortunately, ULTRAKILL's controller inputs are smoothed, which means they stop when time stops too. But there is a solution, altough it be somewhat tideous.

1. Right click ULTRAKILL in your steam library and select `Properties`
2. From there go to the `Controller` tab, and enable `Override for ULTRAKILL`.
3. Click `Controller Configurator` (clickable text in the same tab)
4. Select your controller and set right joystic as mouse movement, and bind any key you want to the keyboard key that uses the Timestopper.

## �What to do if the mod doesn't work / if you find a bug�
Go to the mod's github page [here](https://github.com/GalvinVoltag/The-Timestopper), and create an issue. I'd appreciate if you'd copy-paste the full log (text from the terminal that opens with the game) inside triple quotes (\``` like this ```), it helps me diagnose the problem more efficiently and correctly. *Also you might wanna follow the issue, I might just build a fix release so that you don't need to wait until the next update.*

Each upgrade increases the time by around one second, changes by the upgrade count though. There can be a maximum of 10 upgrades.
