### Abilities:
+ +You can punch enemies in stopped time, and they will keep their momentum
+ +You can still throw coins, parry, use the wiplash, pick up items, etc. in stopped time, just fine
+ +No Weapon Cooldown cheat works with the Gold Arm
+ +Gold Arm is upgradable through terminals fr fr
+ +The Freezeframe is able to move rockets in stopped time with the alt-fire, so you can ride them
+ +The Timestopper can be seen in the main menu when obtained
+ +Customizable animation speed, timestop speed, hard damage, shader effects, maximum upgrades, and more...

### To do:
+ Custom boss to obtain the gold arm from, not a statue that cums it out
+ Make *Special Mode* actually work
+ Make certain bosses able to move in stopped time, optional, maybe
+ More balancing work, overclocking mechanism (just maybe), more visual customization, etc.
+ Add sound to arm pickup animation too
+ Add the warning a sound
+ Add more easter eggs

### Downsides / Current Bugs:
- -Movement is a little bit janky in stopped time.
- -Stuck infinitely after act ending cutscenes, haven't checked if it's still there? (needs testing)
- -No special mode yet
- -No "ZA WARUDO" voiceline yet

### �How to work with controllers?
Unfortunately, ULTRAKILL's controller inputs are smoothed, which means they stop when time stops too. But there is a soltion, altough it be somewhat tideous.

1. Right click ULTRAKILL in your steam library and select `Properties`
2. From there go to the `Controller` tab, and enable `Override for ULTRAKILL`.
3. Click `Controller Configurator` (clickable text in the same tab)
4. Select your controller and set right joystic as mouse movement, and bind any key you want to the keyboard key that uses the Timestopper.

## �What to do if the mod doesn't work / if you find a bug?
Go to the mod's github page [here](https://github.com/GalvinVoltag/The-Timestopper), and create an issue. I'd appreciate if you'd copy-paste the full log (text from the terminal that opens with the game) inside triple quotes (\``` like this ```), it helps me diagnose the problem more efficiently and correctly. *Also you might wanna follow the issue, I might just build a fix release so that you don't need to wait until the next update.*

Each upgrade increases the time by around one second, changes by the upgrade count though. There can be a maximum of 10 upgrades.
