## Disclaimer!
This mod is not recommended for serious playthroughs, it is meant for funzies mostly. It is not fully done and bugs may occur. I recommend you to back up your save files if there is anything important there for you.
It is also very OP, balancing timestop without keeping it as cool as it is is very hard

****

+ You can still throw coins in stopped time, they will remain in air, crazy tricks are possible!

Each upgrade increases the time by around one second, changes by the upgrade count though.
